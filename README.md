# C# Engine

Just a development sandbox where I try various stuff. Written in C# and using bindings (currently through Silk.NET) for low level access.

# Short Term Goals

• Transitioning OpenGL renderer to use modern practices (Multi Draw Indirect + Instancing, Direct State Access, Compute Shader-based culling + tree traversal).

• Create user components to automatically upload scene resource changes to the renderer.

• Cleanup/streamline indirect dependency injection engine-side.
